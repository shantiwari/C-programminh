in this question, you have to output the "two moving average" of a sequence of non-negative numbers.

The two moving average is the sequence of averages of the last 2 entries.
For the first number, no average is output.

For example, if the sequence of numbers is a1,a2,a3,a4,a5
The 2-moving average is  (a1+a2)2,(a2+a3)2,(a3+a4)2,(a4+a5)2
input
-------
The input is a sequence of non-negative floating point numbers, terminated by a -1.
The -1 is not part of the sequence. There will be at least 3 numbers in the sequence.

Output
----------
You have to output the moving average of the sequence. The output should be printed correct to one digit after the decimal.
Hint : Use the format specifier "%.1f" inside printf.

Sample Input 1
---------------------
1 3 2 4 -1

Sample Output 1
-------------------------
2.0 2.5 3.0


#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
float n,a;
scanf("%f",&n);
a=n;
scanf("%f",&n);
while(n!=-1)
{
float mvng=(a+n)/2.0;
a=n;
printf(" %.1f",mvng);
scanf("%f",&n);    
}
return 0;
}
